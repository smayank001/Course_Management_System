"This is a [type of project, e.g., web app, CLI tool] built with [technologies, e.g., Node.js, React] to [purpose, e.g., simplify task X]."

## 📌 Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **Git** (required to clone the repository)
- **A code editor** like VS Code (optional but recommended)

Verify installations by running:

```bash
node -v
git --version
```

## 🚀 Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to the Project Directory

Move into the project folder:

```bash
cd <repository-name>
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

Install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4️⃣ Start the Development Server

```

Once running, open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the terminal) to view the application.

## 🛠️ Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the project once it’s running. For example:

- Visit `http://localhost:3000` and follow the on-screen prompts.
- Run `npm run build` to create a production build.

## 🤝 Contributing
