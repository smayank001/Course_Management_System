## 📌 Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure the following are installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **Git** (required to clone the repository)
- **A code editor** like VS Code (optional but recommended)

Verify installations by running:

```bash
node -v
git --version
```

## 🚀 Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smayank001/Course_Management_System.git
```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to the Project Directory

Move into the project folder:

```bash
cd Course_Management_System
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

Install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4️⃣ Start the Development Server

Launch the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once running, open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in the terminal) to view the application.

## 🛠️ Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the project once it’s running. For example:

- Visit `http://localhost:5173` and follow the on-screen prompts.
- Run `npm run build` to create a production build.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add your message"
   ```
4. Push to the branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. Open a Pull Request.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Error during `npm install`**: Ensure Node.js is installed and your internet connection is active.
- **Port already in use**: Change the port by modifying the startup script in `package.json` or stopping the conflicting process.
